# Hackchat
This is the repo for a instant messaging app created at a hackathon at Cardiff University organised by witlr. We used hip new technologies like AngularJS and NodeJS to create the web app. A team member even worked on a [iOS app](https://github.com/KiranPanesar/HackChat) along side us to connect to the node server with the same functionality. The main functionality is simiar to an IRC or online chat room, you choose a username, select a room to join from the side and message away anonymously!
